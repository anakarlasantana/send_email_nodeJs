# 🚀 Technologies in the API:
- Typescript
- NodeJS
- Express
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- Bcrypt
- Nodemon
- Cors
- Email sending with Nodemailer
- Ethereal Email of test

# 📖 DEV Diary:
- With the depreciation of the getRepository method by TypeORM, I adapted the server to accept the new way of adapting to the database through the AppDataSource.
- Use of the Ethereal Email online tool to test sending emails in development environments.
